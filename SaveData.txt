During the late 17th to the late 18th century, a big change happened called the Enlightenment. Thinkers in Europe and the Americas had new and bold ideas about reason, individualism, and freedom. They questioned the old ways of political authority and social hierarchy. In Europe, people like John Locke and Voltaire challenged kings' divine right. In the Americas, Thomas Paine and Benjamin Franklin spoke up for liberty and equality. This time of Enlightenment was a turning point, making people resist the old political and social systems. Even though some may say resistance came from economic or cultural reasons, the impact of Enlightenment ideas on resisting authority and hierarchy was significant in both Europe and the Americas. This essay will explore this impact by looking at Enlightenment ideas in both places and considering arguments against this influence.
