In a world so vast and wide,
Lives a man with a gentle tide,
Tomas, with a heart so true,
In his eyes, the sky's own blue.

In the meadows of his soul,
Where love plays an endless role,
His words, soft as the morning dew,
Bloom with a love that's ever new.

With every step, Tomas strides,
Carrying dreams like ocean tides,
A spirit free, wild and vast,
Cherishing love that forever lasts.

In his embrace, a haven found,
Where every beat of heart resounds,
With him, every moment shines,
In the dance of the intertwining vines.

Tomas, with a smile so bright,
Turns the darkest day to light,
In his laughter, joy unfurls,
A precious gem in this worldly swirl.

He loves with strength, tender and deep,
In his arms, fears fall asleep,
A love so bold, yet softly spoken,
In his touch, love's sweetest token.

Tomas, a name etched in stars,
In the night sky, from afar,
A love story, beautifully penned,
In the heart, where all journeys end.
