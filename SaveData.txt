The critical examination of urban lighting within this literature review illuminates the intricate relationship between artificial light, energy consumption, and ecological balance. Through the lens of scientific inquiry—spanning from the energy-saving potential identified by Chen et al. (2023) to the astronomical challenges outlined by Australian Sky & Telescope (2023), and Slade's (2022) advocacy for darkness—the need for a harmonious integration of light and darkness in urban design becomes evident. This synthesis underscores the importance of each component discussed, demonstrating their collective relevance to addressing the broader implications of urban lighting. By drawing upon diverse scientific insights, the review advocates for a nuanced approach to urban lighting, one that prioritizes sustainability and the preservation of natural darkness.
