An old argument is, therefore, put across very convincingly by Tina Mao in The Teen Magazine as to the relevance of classic literature in modern-day education. Mao finesses the contrast between classic literature with timeless relevance and inclusion quite beautifully. This is paradoxically clear in her full knowledge of the issues of racism and sexism that are at the base, together with exhortation to read them critically, not to reject them. This points to one side of the value of literature, in the presentation not only of the values and norms of a given society as taken for granted. Significant in this respect is just the manner in which she succeeds where Doane fails. If in the very first place, what comes across your mind is that the coexistence of classics and modern, different literatures can and has equally embraced the international fence of education sceneries throughout the world. At the same time, all this prepared the student to meet the many-sided world in a fevered and critical way in accordance with human life in time and space. As I said in my article, this only serves all the more to undergird what truly potent literature can become in its persuasions upon the mind and urge a more conscientious and open-minded sort of education in which all voices, both temporal and eternal, can get in their say.
