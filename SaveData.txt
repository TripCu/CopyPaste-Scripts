Although both Japan and Russia in the course of industrialization had a considerable degree of state involvement in its process, there seemed to be critically divergent paths, primarily based on different societal structures and geopolitical context between them. Document 7 indicates that the autocratic regime's need for quick industrial and military modernization has been the key driving force in an aggressive industrial push of Russia, many times at the expense of workers' conditions, from top to bottom. Document 8, on its part, brings out the rather balanced approach Japan took with the use of its traditional social order and gradual acceptance of Western technologies, which diluted the kind of excessive harshness visible in Russia. This enabled Japan to create room for a smooth social transition into industrialization, presenting the determinant as lying with the circumstances of each nation to be able to develop a path.
