The Industrial Revolution profoundly impacted women and children, revealing deep class divisions. Working-class women and children were often found in factories and mines, working in dangerous conditions for low pay, a necessity for survival. In stark contrast, middle-class women benefited from their husbands' incomes and adopted domestic roles, fostering a new ideal of womanhood centered on the home. This era also marked the start of social reforms to protect children from industrial labor's harshest abuses, showing a growing consciousness towards protecting the vulnerable. These shifts highlighted the diverse experiences of women and children during the Industrial Revolution and signaled broader social changes.
